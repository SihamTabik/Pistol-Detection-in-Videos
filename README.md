3. File "ComplementaryMaterial.pdf" shows five Figures, Figure 1 and 2 illustrates 6 images from database-2 and database-5. Figure 3, 4 and 5 show some results of the detection model.

4. The videos with the detections (bounding boxes) are named as video-1, -2, -3,-4, -5, -6 and 7.  

5. The thirty scenes used in the expriments are zipped in independent files labeled from 1 to 13.

6. HandgunTrajectory  is a dataset for training models to predict the trajectory of handguns in vidos. (Comming soon)
